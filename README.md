## About

<p> Ride sharing has adapted to the modern world by transforming from a taxi system to a ride sharing system that easily captures and collects ride data. This change in the way we utilize transportation largely facilitates the collection of data that when analyzed, can lead to insights that can help us better understand and improve the way we commute.
 
<br></br>
## Objective
<p> Herin I utilized MatPlotLib to create graphs and scatterplots to analyze data regarding ride sharing.
</p>

## Findings
<p> Urban cities tended to have more drivers, more rides and lower fares whereas rural cities tended to have less drivers, less rides and higher fares.
<p> There is a positive corellation between number of drivers and the size of the city.
<p> There is a negative correlation between fare price and the number of rides.
